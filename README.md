# Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on developing and applying various time series analysis techniques to forecast future data points. It includes the implementation of models like ARIMA, SARIMA, and others to handle non-stationary data and capture trends, seasonality, and noise components in the time series.

## Introduction

Time series analysis is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting future behavior based on past data. In this project, I explored different models to effectively analyze and forecast time series data, particularly focusing on handling non-stationary data through techniques like differencing, autoregression, and moving averages.

## Key Features

- Implementation of Zero Mean Models (White Noise)
- Random Walk Analysis
- Linear Trend Forecasting
- Seasonality Modeling
- ARIMA and SARIMA Models
- Autoregressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) Components
- Visualization of Time Series Data and Forecasts
